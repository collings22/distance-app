Developer notes for further development and considerations going forward.

Progressive Enhancement/Extensibility
- User inputs radius variable
- User inputs location to mark X as distance from
- User selects person from list to mark X as distance from
- Include visual map to see persons within radius
- Utilise all available API endpoints
- Create client side routes

Testing and Logging/Validation
- Research and develop Node.js unit tests
- Develop React component based tests (did mount and validate content)
- Enter appropriate 'benchmark' logs regarding progress of call 

Security Considerations
- JWT validation
- Consider user authentication

Error Handling
- Try alternative route if initial route /people fails
- Alternatively, produce error to User

Multiple Devices and Platforms/Compatibilty
- Test client on IE9
- Test mobile views in browser

Performance
- Look into streaming for increased Performance
